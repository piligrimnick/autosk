/**
 * The live-code hazard guard (plan §3.6, step 5).
 *
 * Workflows and agents are now *code*. If an operator edits an extension so a
 * workflow (or one of its steps) disappears while a task is mid-flight, the
 * task's stored `(workflow, step)` can point at code that no longer exists.
 * There are no frozen copies and no versioning — the registry at (re)load time
 * is the truth.
 *
 * So on every project (re)open, after the registry is built, validate every
 * `work`/`human` task against it: an unknown workflow or an unknown step ⇒ park
 * the task to `human` with `error="workflow_missing: …"`, written via the P2
 * store (status flip + an `autosk`-authored comment recording the reason).
 *
 * Only `work` tasks are actively re-parked. A task already at `human` is not
 * scheduled, so re-parking it would only spam a duplicate comment on every
 * reload; it is left untouched. A valid task is never touched.
 *
 * A `work` task with a null `workflow` or `step` is also parked: an enrolled
 * in-flight task should always carry both, so a null pair is a structural
 * inconsistency (typically an external hand-edit that flipped `status` to `work`
 * without enrolling). The scheduler can never pick it up (no step ⇒ nothing to
 * run), so without this it would stall in invisible limbo — parking it surfaces
 * the bad edit to the operator.
