# autosk-gui

Tauri desktop GUI for [autosk](../README.md), at feature parity with
`autosk lazy`. The frontend is a React + Vite app; the Tauri (Rust) backend is
a **pure JSON-RPC client of `autoskd`** — it does not link `autosk-core` or
doltlite. It talks to the daemon over a Unix-domain socket in **local** mode
(auto-spawning `autoskd` when absent) or over TCP + token in **remote** mode.
The frontend is transport-agnostic: only the Rust backend switches.

> Status: **Phase 4 (v1, lazy parity)** of the Rust-daemon + Tauri-GUI
> initiative. Canonical plan:
> [`docs/plans/20260607-Rust-Daemon-Tauri-GUI.md`](../docs/plans/20260607-Rust-Daemon-Tauri-GUI.md)
> (§6, §9 Phase 4). Final doc/README cutover and CI release gates are Phase 5.
>
> The desktop UI is a **frameless two-panel workspace** — a left sidebar that
> stacks Tasks / Sessions / Workflows as a lazygit-style accordion, and a main
> panel hosting the polymorphic entity view + composer. (Earlier design notes
> for the superseded 3-panel layout live in
> [`docs/plans/20260609-tauri-gui-redesign.md`](../docs/plans/20260609-tauri-gui-redesign.md).)

## Architecture

The design mirrors the CodexMonitor blueprint ("shared core + thin adapters"):

- **One invoke chokepoint.** `src/services/ipc.ts` is the only file that calls
  Tauri `invoke`. Every `autoskd` JSON-RPC method gets a typed shim there; the
  rest of the app calls those functions and never touches `invoke` directly.
  All shims forward through a single generic `daemon_request(method, params)`
  Tauri command.
- **One listen chokepoint.** `src/services/events.ts` is the only file that
  calls Tauri `listen`. It is a ref-counted fan-out hub: one Tauri listener per
  event name serves N React subscribers.
- **Transport-agnostic backend.** The Rust `daemon_request` command is the
  local-vs-remote switch (`if remote { tcp.call } else { uds.call }`).
  `autoskd` JSON-RPC notifications (`job-event`, `task-changed`,
  `project-changed`) are re-emitted verbatim via `app.emit("<same-name>",
  payload)`, so the React layer is oblivious to local-vs-remote. On connect the
  backend auto-issues `task.subscribe` + `project.subscribe` so change pushes
  flow without the frontend knowing the transport.
- **State engine.** A normalized, slice-composed reducer keyed by
  project/task/job/session. A single `selection` (task | session | workflow |
  none) drives the polymorphic center; `state/store.tsx` holds the effects layer
  + the event router that maps notifications into reducer actions. The live
  transcript tail follows either the selected session's job or, when a task is
  selected, the task's newest running job (one `job.subscribe` at a time).
- **UI shell.** A frameless window (macOS `titleBarStyle: Overlay`; Windows
  `decorations:false` + custom caption controls) over a two-panel layout: a
  left **sidebar** that stacks **Tasks**, **Sessions** (all jobs, animated
  status dots) and **Workflows** as a lazygit-style accordion — the active panel
  grows (3:1 weight) while the others collapse, and selecting an entity
  auto-expands its matching panel — and a **main panel** with the polymorphic
  entity view (task sheet with comments / session transcript / read-only
  workflow) plus one entity-aware composer. A titlebar hosts the connection
  indicator and the Agents/Settings modals; the main-panel header hosts the
  project switcher (switch / add / init / remove).

Both invariants are enforced by `scripts/check-ipc-discipline.mjs` (run as part
of `npm run typecheck`) and an eslint `no-restricted-imports` rule, so a stray
`invoke`/`listen` import fails the build.

### Connection lifecycle (local mode)

Mirrors the Go connector (`internal/daemon/rpcclient/connector.go`): resolve the
socket path (`$AUTOSK_SOCK` → `~/.autosk/daemon.sock`), connect-or-spawn
`autoskd serve --sock`, wait for readiness with bounded backoff. The `autoskd`
binary is located via `$AUTOSKD_BIN` → the app-exe / `Resources` dir → `PATH`.
Concurrent first-connects are single-flighted behind a connect lock, and each
connection is tagged with a generation epoch so a superseded connection's late
EOF cannot leak a stale `daemon-status: false` after the replacement is live.

## Scripts

```bash
cd gui
npm install

npm run dev          # Vite dev server (frontend only, no Tauri shell)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit + IPC-discipline guard
npm run test         # vitest (pure reducer/selectors/ipc logic; no browser/daemon)
npm run test:watch   # vitest watch mode
npm run build        # tsc && vite build (production bundle)
npm run lint         # eslint

npm run tauri:dev    # launch the desktop app (needs a display + webkit)
npm run tauri:build  # bundle the desktop app
```

Backend (Rust) checks run from `gui/src-tauri`:

```bash
cd gui/src-tauri
cargo check
cargo test
```

`gui/src-tauri` is a standalone cargo crate, excluded from the root workspace
(see the root `Cargo.toml` `exclude` list), so these commands are independent of
the daemon's doltlite fetch + link.

## Local vs remote mode

Mode is an app setting (persisted; editable from the in-app **Settings** view):

- **Local** — connects over the UDS and auto-spawns `autoskd` if it is not
  already running. Behaves like `autosk lazy`: zero configuration when `autoskd`
  is reachable on `$PATH`.
- **Remote** — dials a configured `host:port` and authenticates with a token
  (first request is `auth{token}`). The remote `autoskd` must be running
  explicitly (you cannot auto-spawn a process on another host). Behaviour is
  identical to local because the frontend is transport-agnostic.

## Known limitations / Phase-5 follow-ups

- **`autoskd` is not yet bundled as a Tauri sidecar.** `tauri.conf.json` has no
  `bundle.externalBin`, and nothing drops `autoskd` into the app bundle. Local
  mode relies on the runtime path resolver (`$AUTOSKD_BIN` → app-exe/`Resources`
  dir → `PATH`), so a packaged `.app` only works in local mode if `autoskd` is
  already on `PATH`. This is fine for the `npm run tauri:dev` milestone; wiring
  the real `externalBin` + per-target-triple sidecar drop is a **Phase 5**
  (release/CI) task.
- **Live runtime is built-to-contract, not headlessly exercised.**
  `npm run tauri:dev` needs a display and the full webkit bundle, so end-to-end
  behaviour (live streaming, composer round-trips, remote-mode parity) is built
  to the JSON-RPC contract and unit-covered at the pure-logic layer, but is not
  exercised in CI. Validate the display-dependent acceptance criteria in a GUI
  environment.
